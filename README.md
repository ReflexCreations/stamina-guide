# Fierra's Guide to Four Panel Stamina

## Preamble

Hello, I'm Brittany (Fierra) and I'm a dance game player that's heavily invested in upper level 'stamina' gameplay. I wanted to put together a guide that would help compile my thoughts into one place. The guide I'm offering is without consultation of others, and entirely based on my own opinions, unfiltered.

Before that, I want to get introduction and naming out of e way. Four panel 'stamina' based gameplay is heavily based around Dance Dance Revolution, which spawned a competitor in In The Groove. In The Groove became a platform for custom content through arcade cabinets' USB stick support in the mid 2000s. This slowly lead to a scene of high level players pushing their physical boundaries. Dance Dance Revolution songs at the time would span in difficulty from level 1 to 10, and In The Groove, loosely similar, would scale from 1 to 13. Players began to wonder "what about a level 14? or 15?" and created content to fill that gap. Over time, this spawned two rules. If it's faster, it's harder. If it's longer, it's harder. Since that point, those original levels have been a loose basis for all further content, which now spans up to level 40. The goal of this guide is to cover what it means to go so fast, and so long, and how to make it so that you, too, can hit the illustrious high level content.

Due to the historical usage of In The Groove for custom content, the games rules on timing and lifebar have remained at the core of the community well into the 2020s. Players generally prefer an emulator, now, but we don't have an official name. ITG, Post-ITG, Stepmania, Four Panel are all names I've heard used, but to make life easier, I'm going to refer to it as Four Panel or Stamina, to be specific about the content we're covering. The software typically used is [ITGMania](https://itgmania.com).

The guide is primarily for players who are moderately comfortable with the concepts of stamina, already, and are capable of reaching levels for entry into Stamina RPG, which starts at level 11. If you're not at that level, this guide won't be particularly relevant to you, and I'd advise the [Starter Pack of Stamina](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vnsJu85DxRA2Spq71g_MheY2B0_j99dPC1ap5RVQX-4) and [Starter Pack of Stamina 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tp8zGud8nKV7yLzUlKP8sdyjRYIDKW3KTTC_xhLDi2Q) packs until you're feeling more comfortable with the game.

I'll be talking mostly about the tournament [Stamina RPG](https://srpg7.groovestats.com), which is an online tournament spanning June-March each year. I'll be using it as a basis to help guide the process of improvement. By following the instructions on the page, you'll be able to set up your accounts, software, and game content. Note that I've linked Stamina RPG 7, which is the event of 2023, and will be replaced year on year. You're also going to need a dance pad, but we'll need to deep dive into that.

When I was getting better at the game, I had to talk to higher level players constantly in order to absorb all of the knowledge that they've accumulated, and come up with my own understanding of how it all works. So this guide is just that. A compilation of thoughts of a high level player, opinionated, and long-winded, to act as a reference of potential useful thoughts to help you on your journey.

Finally, I'd advise joining [Stamina Nation](https://staminanation.com/) on Discord. It's a great community that are happy to help anyone whatever their level.

### Wait, but why?

To start out with, I want to give an example of what this actually _is_. Here's a video of my current maximum, [Footsteps of Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vy_w70kUa4). When people first watch content like this, there's a mixture of thoughts. 'That's not real dancing!', 'That's incredible, how is that possible?', 'You can't possibly be serious.'.. but mostly, the underlying question is **Wait, but why?**

The most interesting part about playing this kind of content is that movement optimisation, muscle conditioning and good technical practice results in a sort of exponential return on investment, in terms of the length you can do. When you begin doing 10 steps per second, it's one of the most powerful feelings in the world, and you'll manage maybe a few seconds before running out of gas. But with a little practice, you'll find that you can soon do a few more seconds. And then you can double that. And then you can double that, too. Before you know it, the amount of time you can play 10 steps per second will be limited only by your desire to stand up and do it for that long.

The progression of the number of steps you can perform in a given time frame is a lot more of a linear, or even logarithmic return process. But the faster you go, the less time you'll be able to sustain it. For example, at 10 steps per second, you may handle an entire minute. At 12 steps per second, you may lock up within a few seconds. As you become faster, you'll be able to handle slower content for longer. As you become able to play slower content for longer, you'll be able to go faster. The joy of performing 10 steps per second for the first time is unbelievable, for those few seconds. So when you begin doing it for minutes at a time, you begin to feel like a monster.

For some of us, this feeling moves into 20 steps per second and above. It's addictive, and it feels incredible, it feels like Dragonball Z, with absurd power levels that go beyond and beyond. And then, you keep pushing speed and stamina until you get to be at the point that I'm at in the video above. And then you keep going, still. I love this game, for its benefits to my physical health, mental wellbeing, the community I've been involved in, the skills I've picked up, and the feeling of pride I get from high level attainments. I've slowly blended my physical skill with my technical skill in improving at the game. It's an incredible synergy, letting both myself and my pad and environment improve. That's why I play, and that's why I want to share what I know.

## Picking a dance pad

Firstly, there's only one standardised rule at the moment, and that is the gap between panels. Your center panel should be a square of 11", or 280mm, separating the four cardinal panels you play on. How deep below, or raised above the center panel those cardinal arrows are is fair game. How wide your panels are is also fair game, where some choose a lower-profile 'Travel Pad' style design that's more portable. But whatever you choose, you should make sure your panels are spaced at least 11"/280mm apart, with at most, some small gap of around 1/8" between the cardinal and center panels.

Personally, I play on a [RE:Flex Dance Pad](https://reflex.dance), it's a DIY project I run, a little bit hard to obtain the parts for, and has some high technical knowledge requirements. That's just a shameless plug, though. There's a great guide in [ITG Resource](https://nvplus.github.io/itg-guide/pads.html). But in terms of quality, you don't really need an awful lot. Yuzu is a player who plays on [Force Sensitive Resistors, glued to the floor, with Yugioh cards on top of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsLaV4BusjQ). And yet he's one of the top three stamina players in the world at time of writing. 

Many players prefer to focus on themselves, when thinking of improvement. The truth is, it's symbiotic. Your dance pad suits your form, your form suits your dance pad. Sometimes, pushing harder isn't better, and instead, modifying your dance pad will give incredible returns. Comparing a lot of the top players, and the variability in their dance pad, I can spot four identifying factors in terms of getting the perfect platform to improve your game upon.

### Panel Sensitivity

For sensors, old-school arcade dance pads, using thin sheets of copper with a little flexible material between. By pressing the panel with your foot, the copper sheets make contact, and this would count as a press of the panel. This is finicky, and non-ideal. The geometry of the sensors varied wildly depending on the dance pad build. The sensitivity was often far too low for most players' comfort, resulting in a lot of modifications to get everything 'just right', though still never quite met the mark for many.

Nowadays, Force Sensitive Resistors or FSRs are the choice for most players. The software for input made by [TeejUSB](https://github.com/teejusb/fsr) is excellent and has a great setup guide. Load cells are also an attractive option but require a lot more mechanical and electronic support. I hope one day we'll get to the point it's the community standard, but for now, FSRs are more DIY-friendly, much quicker to set up and easier to maintain. Whatever pad you pick, go into it expecting to upgrade to FSRs or load cells.

With the consistent response of FSRs and load cells, and the ability to modify their sensitivity quickly in software, this allows you to find the best sensitivities for your current needs. There's a lot more that can be done here, with some rather smart decisions in software processing to filter inputs from non-inputs. Personally, I use [software](https://github.com/brittanyb/playground) with thresholds to adjust for the panel turning on, and turning off (hysteresis), and allow any of the four sensors in the corner of each panel to turn the panel on.

Finally, make sure your panels don't have 'dead zones'. They should be sensitive all over, especially towards the inner edges and corners, towards the center panel. There are a number of fixes if your panel does have dead zones, and you may find more information asking around on Stamina Nation.

### Panel Depth/Height

Old-school arcade dance pads had panels several millimeters below the center panel. Over time, players didn't enjoy the feeling of dipping their feet so far in, and those players began to modify their dance pads to have panels more flush with the center panel. Even further, players began to raise their panels. Personally, my up and down panels are raised over 1/2" or 12mm each above the center panel as my playstyle has adapted. The most important factor here is that whatever surfaces you use for your cardinal panels, they should be easily raised and lowered, towards the inner edge of your center panel.

This is a big part of the feedback process in improvement, and I can't stress how iterative this. If this is difficult, and requires a lot of unscrewing and modification, you'll likely raise your panels too far, find it terribly uncomfortable, and drop them back where they were. Personally, my panels have velcro risers, allowing me to lift the panels with enough force from my hands, place further velcro risers in/remove them, and replace the panels quickly, allowing me to perform these adjustments whenever I like. This doesn't have to be particularly complicated. Again, Yuzu with his Yugioh cards being used to raise his panel surfaces is more than acceptable enough to have a high performance dance pad.

You'll want the panels to have edges that aren't particularly sharp, too. Otherwise you'll rip up your socks and toes. A slight bevel to the edges will do anything.

### Bar positioning

The bar position is important for allowing you to position and distribute your weight, along with balancing during play. Old-school arcade pads had fixed bars, typically built around whatever was believed to be an 'average-sized' player, spaced quite distant from the dance pad surface. Nowadays, players prefer to have a bar suited for around their height, personal preference, and it's often a lot closer to the dance pad surface itself. Personally, mine is relatively low, despite being 5'8", and is positioned quite far over the down arrow. 

As before, being able to modify the bars position easily is a very important facet. Mine's adjustable, and has moved in its depth, height, and where I hold it horizontally over time. DIY options include barres used for ballet, and even zimmer frames. I tend to move my bar based on how my back and arms feel, and try to keep it supporting as much of my weight as possible while staying comfortable during my gameplay. This is a personal process, but is worth experimenting with, as it'll teach you a lot about your form and how you should be using the bar to support your improvement.

### Center panel

Sliding across the center panel is a major factor in improvement. To do that, you should have a smooth surface. For the panel itself, I would suggest either a stainless steel panel, or one like mine, which uses just about any base material, and has layers of primer, paint, and lacquer with hardener on top of it. There's not too much to talk about here, but it should be hard, smooth, flat and stiff. There's a lot more in managing the slideyness of the center panel, but that's a later topic.

### Closing thoughts

That's about it for the pad. The important part is that you're going to be working within a non-stop iterative process, with variability happening in your body as well as the pad over time. As you can see, there's no simple "get this, and it does everything" answer. Whatever you choose, there's DIY. Getting comfortable with creating the best setup and maintaining it will be a massive benefit to your ability to improve at the game, and with a skill as optimised as this, try to be very aware of the tiny, tiny changes to your pad that might help you.

## Form

### The best form

Form is how you choose to move when hitting the arrows in gameplay. Dom has an [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwWgmGjeyRs) showing the different form styles. He makes great cases in comparing the main forms and concludes with the belief that based may be the best of them, but suggests to play whichever you feel comfortable with. This is where I differ, and feel that if you want to be one of the best, regardless of how good you already are, you should learn the based, or toes-out form.

The first time I saw based form, it was Trevor, or trev0115, in early 2016. It was kind of terrifying, really. Up until that point, Mad Matt had been far and out the best player, ever. Then this kid showed up, and started playing with his toes outward to hit up, left and right, and heels only for down. It was very uncommon. At the time, many of us chalked it up to just being a bit of an irrelevant artefact. There was something else making him special. Maybe his size. Something. But he got _good_ in a scary way, and quickly. He quickly became the best player, and pushed into doing things that didn't make sense. At a time where < 5 players had passed Last Trip, Trevor could pass it at 110% music rate. Truth is, we'd all learned heels out back in the earlier days because it was the one way to get enough of our weight on any undersensitive panels to actually trigger them. But Trevor played on a home pad, and played upper level content on it, never moving away from toes out.

Since that point, levitass especially has pushed the boundary, going into levels I genuinely believed were physically impossible only a short number of years ago. The best players all appear to play based. I don't think it's a coincidence, but rather a very specific case that those who learn it benefit from it, and can become incredible.

### Why is based so good?

I'm a heels out player by nature, with my heels pivoting to hit down, left and right, my toes on up. I got [pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pCpLWBZZN4), but never one of the best. I moved to based form in July 2022, having to completely start again. My logic was "If I'm never going to be the best, then what do I have to lose by trying to be as good as I can?". I had enough evidence that it was better, and I quickly learned that based is by far the best form for four panel stamina.

As Dom points out in his video, you're not moving your feet. Your toes have a pivot for left/right/up, and your heels hit the down arrow. So the only movements are pivoting, or a slight push back and forward on your heel, where your heels never leave the dance pad. I'd equate it to the [Fosbury Flop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosbury_flop), but far more powerful a paradigm shift.

At first, I had a hard time adjusting. I dropped from level 20 back to level 9. It wasn't nice. The panels never seemed to trigger, so I had to mess around a lot with my panel heights and my panel sensitivities. I couldn't keep my heels on the center panel. Then I started getting better. I noticed on marathons that my back simply didn't hurt anymore, like it used to as I wasn't regularly lifting my heels and causing stress on my back. I noticed that I wasn't becoming exhausted anymore, because my movement was so reduced. My sessions became longer, more frequent.

### Optimisation

I learned how to slide with this form the most, as the movement became easier to master. This is because in based, all my heels are doing is moving up and down, in a push and pull motion, while my toes handle the pivoting motion. Having your feet always firmly putting your bodyweight on the center panel let's you move at unbelievable speed.

You will find that with raised panels, it becomes a lot easier for your form to be controlled. A higher down arrow will prevent your heel from sliding over the edge, and helps you to remain with your heels firmly on the center panel, relying mostly on a 'bumping' motion to hit the down. For left and right, a slight raise allows the the toes to more easily apply pressure without extending too far. For the up arrow, a large raise prevents the foot from pushing over it, only allowing the toes the maximum movement. Again, this is iterative and requires regular change and experimentation. But over time, if you're doing it right, your panels should be raising and improving your form.

There's no consensus yet on how far the pivot should be. Logically, we should expect that the less rotation of your feet for left, up and right, and the less movement of the heels, the better you will be. Logically also, having some grip on the panels, by having more pivot, and more foot in contact with the panel, allows you to push off of it onto your next panel. For that reason, try not to focus too hard on the pivot range.

None of this is absolute. I have a slight lean onto my right foot, and my left foot moves more as a result. My left foot also likes to overshoot the down arrow at times, and the heel leaves the center if I'm not careful. The important thing is to be aware of these factors, and work on them.

### Injury

Based also introduced me to my first non-trivial dance game injury, as it has with several people. Going so fast, getting that good, that quickly, being able to go so hard for so long, it's very tempting to push yourself too far, or to ignore the advice to settle down, because you feel fine. I know, because I ran tendons first into that issue.

I got digitorum longus extensor tendonitis in my right foot. The quick gains I made by going too hard were very much offset by my nine month recovery. Ultimately, you can't _just_ slide. Depending on the patterns, your feet may already be on the panel they're meant to hit next, in which case, you will need to lift a little, or rock/micro-pivot in some way. This isn't as much about logic as it is about practice. You eventually get comfortable with the movements. But my major suggestion here is don't play in pain. And for at least the first six months, please avoid any longer marathons. 

Marathons will cause the most repetitive strain, and aren't worth it at this stage. They're not the best way to improve. The unoptimised, new movement that's honestly quite unnatural to your body carries the tendonitis risk. Don't play in pain, it's not worth the risk. If you're feeling the strain, take a break from the game. Start again when you're no longer feeling it. Trust me that any of the amazing, explosive gain I made in those few first months of based were quickly offset by the nine month recovery. If I'd have gone at half the speed, I'd have done far better, far quicker, with just a bit of patience.

After my second season with based form, I can say now that I just don't face tendonitis anymore. The movement is natural enough to me, now, and injury appears to be at bay, for now, and I'm good to do lots of marathons and just about any content I like.

## Patterns

### Steppy and slidey

Checking out the [Stamina Pattern Reference Guide](https://nvplus.github.io/itg-guide/patterns.html), I'll use this as reference when talking about patterning for this section. There's a few terms that will help understanding of how this all works and applies to based. Players often refer to patterns as either 'slidey' or 'steppy'. 'Slidey' patterns on this page are exampled by the different staircases, helicopters and zeta slides, and 'steppy' by hipbreakers, luchis,towers, etc. Something is steppy if you are lifting your feet to hit panels multiple times in a row, and slidey if you are always moving your feet from panel to panel instead. For based form, it appears that sliding is the king, allowing you to rapidly trigger a lot of panels through quick pivots and panel-bumping with minimal foot raising. Does that mean it's the only thing that you can do with based? No.

My experience of based is that although it tends to work best with slidey patterns, based is still best when it comes to most patterns. I may've improved massively with sliding patterns in based form, but I've also improved at steppy patterns, just not as much. Nonetheless, depending on the proportion of slidey to steppy patterns, my experience of a stepchart can greatly change. This has always been the case with any form I've had, with deficiencies and optimisations being applicable to all. But based has allowed me to conquer a hell of a lot more than I've done with any other form.

### Mono-directional

Mono-directional or 'mono' patterns are those in which the foot hitting the up and down arrow does not alternate. This naming comes from the oldest form of high-level stamina play, where players would be positioned mostly over the brackets of the panels, with 'facing right' indicating a player with their right foot on the down and right panels, and left foot on up and left, and 'facing left' with their right foot on up and right, and left foot on down and left. For a good example of mono patterns, a double staircase is a mono-directional pattern, an alternating staircase is not.

Back in those dark ages, 'mono' was considered to be lazy, easy patterning, due to the fact that you 'didn't have to move'. Nowadays, it throws off most optimised forms and is considered much harder to execute. At high speeds, mono patterning keeps your form unbalanced.

### Why don't patterns affect difficulty?

The truth is, they do, very much. If you made a chart of only tower patterns, I probably would be reduced to around half of my maximum speed and longevity.

The problem is, patterning is subjective. As I mentioned with mono patterns being considered easy in the past (often associated with some pretty crude 2000s name-calling that doesn't fit well into the 2020s), we now consider it far harder. Though it may've been nearly cheating back then, now it's an example used to discredit higher-level form.

Based might be the best we have right now, but I'm not convinced that it's the 'final' form. As we improve, we want to continue to improve, and we change ourselves, and the game to facilitate it. By mostly disregarding patterns in difficulty, it lets us stick to the objective fact that speed and length defines difficulty.

For the subjectivity of pattern difficulty, we may one day hope to quantify patterns more. Until that point, top level players will simply say "that chart had insane patterns!" even if it's not at the maximum 'difficulty level' that player can handle. And at this point in time, based players typically prefer bi-directional patterns with lots of sliding, and varying levels of steppiness to keep things interesting.

For a visual example, [Mission Complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPM3f4w8MFM) was a very hard 'patterny' chart at level 28 for me. [Departure 6 FB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB9FIKxP6mY), is a lot faster, but considered to have very easy patterns, with lots of sliding.
